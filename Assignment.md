## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course (yes, we all came in with some big hopes 😅).
For each one, mention:

What you thought it would be like **(Expectation 👀)**

What you actually learned **(Reality 😅)**

And how it helped with your personal portfolio project 💻

make it honest—and if it surprised you, even better!

Example format:
**🧠 What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**
**1. Concept: Branching**

`Expectation 👀` : I thought branching was just for developers working on big apps—nothing I’d need for a small project.

`Reality 😅`: Turns out even solo devs need branches! It helped me avoid breaking my main code while testing new designs.

`Impact 💡`: I created a feature branch for my "About Me" section and merged it smoothly into the main branch after testing. Super useful!

**🧠 What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned:**

**1. Concept: Git Merge**

`Expectation 👀` : I thought merging/ handling merge conflicts was just mixing different branches of code to one main repository

`Reality 😅`: Handling merge conflict requires careful selection of code to include and/or exclude from repository.

`Impact 💡`: I successfully handled at least 5 merge conflicts!

**2. Concept: Git Rebase**

`Expectation 👀` : I thought Git Rebase is complicated because I assumed it causes more merge conflicts when the same line is edited

`Reality 😅`: Turns out Git Rebase replays commits one by one, so conflicts can occur per commit but it actually gives finer control over resolving them compared to a messy merge.

`Impact 💡`: Cleaner and more linear merge history


**3. Concept: Git Pages**

`Expectation 👀` : I initially thought the only way to preview and view a website is deployment from my localhost.

`Reality 😅`: Turns out Git Pages creates an easy, workable interface to view the implementation of your code!

`Impact 💡`: Faster development with less resources.

**3. Concept: GitHub Syntax**

`Expectation 👀` : I initially thought there was no standard format for commit messages and repository communication among members.

`Reality 😅`: Turns out Syntax, such as that used in commit messages and labelling issues, is a real thing

`Impact 💡`: Easier communication with collaborators, cleaner commit history. 


## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Include screenshots that demonstrate how you used GitHub to manage your project. For each screenshot, write a short caption explaining what it shows.

> Upload the screenshots to your GitHub repository and reference them here using Markdown image syntax:
> (you could just simply copy and paste the image into the Assignment.md)
